HyperionTransit
==========

## Summary

HyperionTransit is a web-based application for integrating and visualizing data that transit agencies commonly maintain in order to inform operational, programmatical and infrastructural interventions. It was conceived and developed by Jonathan Hoagland Leape between 2016 and 2017 in Bogot√°, Colombia for Transmilenio S.A.

The application processes input data into the following units of analysis: stations, stops, routes, route segments, corridor segments, and origin - destination pairs. Calculated attributes of each unit of analysis are summarized in a interactive map, plots, tables and reports. Processed data can be downloaded and uploaded in order to easily compare.

### 3) Interactive Map

#### Controls

The Controls panel dynamically adapts to only display inputs relevant to the selected study element. It can be dragged if it blocks a visualization on the map and automatically fades when the cursor is not hovering in order to reveal the map behind it.

* **Time of Day** - slider input to determine the time of day of data to be visualized on the map and in plots. This input applies to all study elements. Some study elements only have one time period (Ex. AM peak), and the slider must be set to this time for the data to appear. Click the play button to animate the slider, and the affected visualizations will update accordingly. Press the pause button to stop the animation.

* **Study Element** - select input to determine study element to be visualized on the map and in plots. The remaining section of the control panel will adapt according to the study element selected.

##### Stations

Display stations found in **Station Inventory** thematically.

* **Color Variable** - select the variable used to determine the color of the station circles.

* **Size Variable** - select the variable used to determine the size of the station circles. 

* **Station** - select input to focus on a particular station. Selecting a station will create a pop-up at the station on the map with key indicators. 

* **Spider** the user can draw desire lines to and from the selected station. The user must choose a percentile range in the **Percentile** slider input to determine how many desire lines to display. Checking the attractions box with show desire lines to the selected station. By default, trip productions are displayed. Click **Station Spider** action button to display desire lines.

##### Stops

Display stops found in **GTFS** feed thematically.

* **Stop Types** - checkbox input to select which types of stops found in the GTFS feed to show. Checking **Station** displays a circle for each parent station. Checking **Platform** shows a circle for each stop that is associated with a parent station. Checking **Stop** shows each road-side stop which is not associated with a parent station.

##### Routes

Display routes found in **GTFS** feed thematically.

* **Agencies** - select input to filter routes by agency.

* **Stops At** - select input to filter routes by stops served.

* **Origin Zone** - select input to filter routes by origin zone.

* **Destination Zone** - select input to filter routes by destination zone.

* **Operator** - select input to filter routes by operator.

* **Indicator** - select input to filter routes by indicator and determine mapping theme.

* **Indicator Percentiles** - slider input to determine the number of routes to be displayed according to their ranking for the chosen indicator.

* **Routes** - select input to select specific routes to be mapped. If none are selected, all routes that pass the previous filters will be mapped.

Click the **Display Routes** action button to map routes, and **Clear Routes** to clear them.


##### Route Segments

Display route-segment saturation according to Emme output or observed on-off counts thematically on the map.

* **Route** - select input to choose route.

##### Corridor Segments

Dispay corridor-segment saturation, the sum of demand over the sum of capacity across all routes for each segment, thematically on the map.

* **Corridors** - select input to determine which corridor is shown in the Corridor Saturation - Profile plot.

All corridors will be displayed on the map since they do not conflict spatially. Corridor segments are offset so that saturation can be visualized by direction.

##### O-D Pairs

Display desire lines between origin-destination pairs thematically on the map.

* **Corridors** - select multiple corridors for which desire lines will be displayed.

* **Intra-zonal** - when checked, desire lines connecting stations within the same corridor will be excluded.

* **Unidirectional** - when checked, desire lines will only be shown between corridors in the order that they were input in **Corridors**

* **Percentile** - slider to determine the range of desire lines to be displayed.

* **Variable** - select variable used in filtering and to determine opacity of desire lines. Transit trips and auto trips are in passengers per hour. Travel Time Ratio is the ratio of travel time by transit according to the GTFS feed, including access, transfer and egress times, and travel time by auto. Travel Time Lost is the difference between travel time by transit and travel time by auto, multiplied by the number of transit trips.

* **Color** - select color of desire lines.

* **Display Lines** - add desire lines to map.

* **Clear Lines** - remove desire lines from map.


#### Map

The map is a CartoDB rendering of OpenStreetMaps. The Leaflet library is used to display circles and lines thematically to visualize data. 

The map is automatically centered at the centroid of the stops found in the GTFS feed, and can be dragged. The map can be zoomed by scrolling or by clicking on the +/- buttons in the top left corner. 

Below the zoom buttons is the layer control, which will expand when the cursor hovers over it. HyperionTransit automatically selects which layers to show or hide for each study element, but the layers can be managed manually by checking and unchecking boxes in the layer control.

Below the layer control is the map legend for the themes of the selected study element.

In the bottom left corner is the drawing toolbox. 

* The star button is used to style (change color, opacity or stroke of) drawn lines.

* Below the star button are buttons for drawing polylines, which may represent proposed routes, circles, which may represent areas of influence, and markers, which may represent proposed stations, stops, interchanges, terminals, destinations, etc.

* Below the drawing buttons is a button for editing drawn objects and a button for deleting them.

Currently, objects drawn using this toolbox cannot be downloaded.


#### Plots

The Plots panel includes expandable windows, each containing a graphic relevant to the data filtered via the Control panel. It can be dragged if it blocks a visualization on the map and automatically fades when the cursor is not hovering in order to reveal the map behind it.

* **Station Saturation - Bullet** - bullet chart showing the three types of saturation for the selected station. The colored background matches the theme of the circles on the map. The horizontal black bar indicates the saturation at the selected time. The vertical black line indicates the maximum saturation of the station in the entire day.

* **Station Saturation - Timeline** - line chart of demand and capacity of the selected saturation type for the selected station over the course of the day.

* **Route Saturation - Profile** - line chart of the demand and capacity of the route selected under Route Segments in the Control panel.

* **Boarding Saturation - Bar Chart** - bar chart of boardings and vacancies at the seleted time for each route serving the selected station.

* **Corridor Saturation - Profile** - line chart of demand and capacity of the selected corridor selected under Corridors in the Control panel.

* **Recomendations** - table listing recommended interventions for the selected station, based on the three saturation types. The table is editable so the user can modify the cost, effectiveness and quantity of each intervention. The summarization of these inputs in the Investment Plan output is under development.

### 4) Station Design

The Station Design tab shows CAD drawings of stations so they can be reviewed when considering infrastructure interventions.

* **Station** - select the station.

* **Drawing** - select which drawing of the station to view.

### 5) Plots

The Plots tab displays the same plots found in the Plots panel of the Interactive Map, but larger so they can be studied in detail.

* **Plot** - select which plot to display.

### 6) Tables

Each working table can be viewed in the Tables tab to quickly find statistics. In the top left, the number of entries shown can be modified. In the top right, the user can search for elements of the table. The arrows next to each column header can be clicked to sort the table according the the values in that column. Below each column header is an input box to filter the table by searching in the specific column. Click rows to highlight them.

* **Stations** - Demand, Capacity and Saturation for each type (Buses in Stations, Passengers in Turnstiles, Passenger in Bays) by station by hour.

* **Stops** - to be added.
